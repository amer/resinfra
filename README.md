# Asynchronous Daily Stand-ups | [article](https://medium.com/@stevoscript/why-your-team-should-try-asynchronous-daily-stand-ups-87f1b809e5c8)

1. What did you do yesterday? (suggestion: the last time?)
1. What did you do today?
1. Is there anything blocking you from moving forward?

## 27.11.2020
1. The last two days I was busy at work. Sorry, I couldn't join the Scrum poker
2. Today, I'll follow up with the planned stories and pickup stories to work on.
3. No blockers.

### Amer
1. On 25.11.2020, I finished [#73](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/73/use-terraform-to-create-a-virtual-machine-on-azure-in-an-configured-vpc) and [#80](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/80/use-terraform-to-create-a-vm-and-a-suitable-network-configuration-for-azure) and merged into `main`.
2. I'll not work today because of tech problems at work.
3. No blockers.

## 25.11.2020
### Julian
1. The last time, i solved change request
2. Today, I will plan some stories for the next week and have a look into a more asynchronous communication.
3. Nearly no work is done but no one came up with issues or questions. So i am not sure if they are done and simply not finished documenting or if they don't fulfill our submission policy. Because i don't know their experience and the results of the research task, I am not sure how to proceed with story creation.

### Amer
1. Yesterday, 
	- Reviewed story [#82](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/82/investigate-and-demonstrate-a-solution-for-monitoring-a-vm)
	- Read about virtual networking and service meshes.
2. Today, I'll work on [#73](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/73/use-terraform-to-create-a-virtual-machine-on-azure-in-an-configured-vpc) and [#80](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/80/use-terraform-to-create-a-vm-and-a-suitable-network-configuration-for-azure)
3. No blockers.


## 24.11.2020
### Nitho
1. Yesterday I looked into how Consul handle multi-datacenter implementation
2. Jan mention an interesting idea about making the whole system event-driven (possibly based on Kafka). I will look into this today
3. Since Consul use gossip communication for its service discovery, it can be too chatty if there are a lot of events going on.

### Roland
1. I have read up on the topic of network configuration in AWS
2. I created a terraform script to deploy a fully configured vm in AWS with a VPC, a subnet, a public IP address, an internet gateway and security groups
3. I wrote a small piece of documentation for the terraform script


### Tim
1. Yesterday I created an `ansible playbook` that sets up an Nginx web server
   using docker containers.
2. Today, I'll work on automatically running the playbook once the machines/ssh
   are ready. Also I'll finish my documentation for both terraform and Ansible.

## 23.11.2020
### Johann
1. Yesterday, I did nothing.
2. Today, I'll work on [#120](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/120/investigate-and-design-an-architecture-to-connect-the-vms-across-different-cloud-provider-aws-and-azure). Because I don't know all that much about internet routing, I need to spend a lot of time reading up on the basics.
3. Because I'm spending a lot of time learning, the item might not be completed this sprint.

### Julian
1. The last time, i created a terraform configuration to create VMs on Proxmox.
2. Today, i will try to resolve some change requests that i got from my team members.
3. Currently, i am done with my stories, but i have to take a look in the stories for the next weeks. Some stories may be evolving from currently not fulfilled stories, so i am not sure how to react to the delay.

## Nitho
1. On Saturday I started to look into various service registry implementation, but no concrete ideas yet.
2. Today I will look further into Consul, which was the main suggestion during the meeting.
3. Not really at the moment, since this is just an exploratory phase now.

### Roland
1. I have set up and initialized my AWS student account
2. I developed a basic terraform script which deploys a ubuntu vm to AWS EC2

### Tim
1. Yesterday I created a terraform script that deploys a VM
2. Today I'll look into `ansible` as an easy deployment tool to deploy an
   application as defined in
   [#77](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/77/use-an-easy-deployment-tool-to-deploy-an-application-via-docker-on-the-vms)


## 21.11.2020
### Julian
1. The last time, i did planing for the next sprint.
2. Today, I'will use terraform to create a VM on an Proxmox server.
3. Currently i am not aware anything blocking me.

### Roland
1. I have read the documentation of terraform in order to get a basic understanding of the tool

### Tim
1. Familiarized myself with `terraform` by reading documentation and setting it up
2. Today I'll try and setup an `aws ec2` machine using `terraform`
3. No blocking points thus far.
