1. Yesterday, I did nothing.
2. Today, I'll work on [#120](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/120/investigate-and-design-an-architecture-to-connect-the-vms-across-different-cloud-provider-aws-and-azure). Because I don't know all that much about internet routing, I need to spend a lot of time reading up on the basics.
3. Because I'm spending a lot of time learning, the item might not be completed this sprint.
