### Julian 
1. The last time, i solved change request
2. Today, I will plan some stories for the next week and have a look into a more asychronious communication.
3. Nearly no work is done but no one came up with issues or questions. So i am not sure if they are done and simply not finished documenting or if they dont fulfill our submission policy. Because i dont know their expercience and the results of the research task, I am not sure how to proceed with storie creation.

### Nitho
1. Yesterday I looked into how Consul handle multi-datacenter implementati
2. Jan mention an interesting idea about making the whole system event-driven (possibly based on Kafka). I will look into this today
3. Since Consul use gossip communication for its service discovery, it can be too chatty if there are a lot of events going on.

### Johann
1. Yesterday, I did nothing.
2. Today, I'll work on [#120](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/120/investigate-and-design-an-architecture-to-connect-the-vms-across-different-cloud-provider-aws-and-azure). Because I don't know all that much about internet routing, I need to spend a lot of time reading up on the basics.
3. Because I'm spending a lot of time learning, the item might not be completed this sprint.

### Julian
1. The last time, i created a terraform configuration to create VMs on proxmox.
2. Today, i will try to resolve some change requests that i got from my team members.
3. Currentyl i am done with my stories, but i have to take a look in the stories for the next weeks. Some stories may be evolving from currently not fullfilled stories, so i am not sure how to react to the delay.

## Nitho
1. On saturday I started to look into varius service registry implementation, but no concrete ideas yet.
2. Today I will look further into Consul, which was the main suggestion during the meeting.
3. Not really at the moment, since this is just an exploratory phase now.

### Julian
