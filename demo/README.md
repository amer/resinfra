# Demo 

This is the demonstration for our final presentation as described in [story
294](https://app.clubhouse.io/thinkdeep/story/294/create-a-scenario-story-for-the-final-demonstration-that-includes-the-use-of-the-database-in-an-easy-and-understandable-way)

There are two python scripts, `counter.py` and `listener.py`.  Install requirements with pip e.g.
`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`. Change the sql connection string in `env.sh` 
for both connections according to the nodes you want to use and source it.

You can then run the counter script as well as the listener (e.g. in new terminal).

TODO: no network partition between both
